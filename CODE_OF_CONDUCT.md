# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of Well pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
* Personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including GitHub, discussions, chat, and any public events — and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at [conduct@wellapp.ai](mailto:conduct@wellapp.ai). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

All reports will be handled with discretion and respect for the privacy of the reporter.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
