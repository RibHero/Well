### Instructions:

LOGO
- Fetch the brandâ€™s official logo online.
- Render it as low-res, dithered thermal print output. No clean vectors.

LAYOUT & TYPOGRAPHY

- Text should show subtle misalignment and faded ink.
- Fold lines must distort or fade text slightly.

RECEIPT POSITION
- Show receipt lying flat on a countertop.
- Include a mild curl from the roll, partially flattened.
- Add a fold or crease, preferably one already present.
- Slight edge tearing or thermal paper texture is ideal.

BACKGROUND
- Use an authentic cashier/bar countertop (e.g., woodgrain, laminate, or speckled stone).
- Lightly blur background for shallow depth of field, no excessive darkening.

LIGHTING & PHOTOGRAPHY EFFECTS
- Apply warm, indoor ambient lighting (cafÃ©/bar vibe).
- Simulate a real phone photo with:
  - Light lens flare
  - Smudges/reflections
  - Minor blur, digital grain
  - Optional vignetting
